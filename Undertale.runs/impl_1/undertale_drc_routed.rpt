PREG Output pipelining  
DSP game_page/rgb3 output game_page/rgb3/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0).

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP game_page/rgb3 multiplier stage game_page/rgb3/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net color_decode/hex_reg[11]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin color_decode/hex_reg[11]_i_2/O, cell color_decode/hex_reg[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vga/v_val_reg[3]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga/rgbCode_reg[0]_i_1__0/O, cell vga/rgbCode_reg[0]_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
