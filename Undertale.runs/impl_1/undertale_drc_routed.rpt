DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP intro_page/rgb0 output intro_page/rgb0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP intro_page/rgb0 multiplier stage intro_page/rgb0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller/hex_reg[11]_i_2/O, cell controller/hex_reg[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller/page_num_reg[0]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller/selection[1]_i_2/O, cell controller/selection[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller/page_num_reg[1]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller/pos_x[11]_i_2/O, cell controller/pos_x[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT controller/pos_x[11]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 24 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
game_page/pos_x_reg[0], game_page/pos_x_reg[10], game_page/pos_x_reg[11], game_page/pos_x_reg[1], game_page/pos_x_reg[2], game_page/pos_x_reg[3], game_page/pos_x_reg[4], game_page/pos_x_reg[5], game_page/pos_x_reg[6], game_page/pos_x_reg[7], game_page/pos_x_reg[8], game_page/pos_x_reg[9], game_page/pos_y_reg[0], game_page/pos_y_reg[10], game_page/pos_y_reg[11] (the first 15 of 24 listed)
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT controller/selection[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
